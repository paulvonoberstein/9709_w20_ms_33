    <!-- Question 1: Modulus -->
    <div id = "Question_1">
    <img src = "Q1.png" alt = " Q1: Solve the inequality 2 - 5x > 2|x-3|">
    
    
    <p class = "explanation centre"> The safest way to do this question is to square both sides and use a number line to check your answer. <br>
       Note that the modulus function and the square function are similar in that they both invert negative values but leaves positive values alone.<br>

    <span class = "equation">
    (2 - 5x)<sup>2</sup> > (2|x - 3|)<sup>2</sup> <br>

    25x<sup>2</sup> - 20x + 4 > 4x<sup>2</sup> - 24x + 36 <br>
    21x<sup>2</sup> + 4x - 32 > 0 <br>
    </span>
     
    This is not a simple quadratic to solve, but we can use the quadratic formula to get: <br>
    
    <span class="equation">
    x = <sup>-4</sup>/<sub>3</sub> or <sup>8</sup>/<sub>7</sub> <br>
    </span>
      
    note that you should use an = instead of a > or < at this stage. We have to use a number line to check the region(s) of the answer. <br> 
    We'll check using -2, 0 and 2. As for the reason; 0 is a very convenient number to try because any term which contains x will turn into 0.  
    Always try 0 when your number line contains a positive and a negative number. <br> 
    -2 and 2 are the smallest whole numbers above and below <sup>-4</sup>/<sub>3</sub> and <sup>8</sup>/<sub>7</sub>, but you can try any number within the regions x < <sup>-4</sup>/<sub>3</sub> 
    and the other region x > <sup>8</sup>/<sub>7</sub>. <br>
      
    <span class="equation">
    21(-2)<sup>2</sup> + 4(-2) - 32 = 44 <br>
    21(0) + 4(0) - 32 = -32 <br>
    21(2)<sup>2</sup> + 4(2) - 32 = 60 <br>
    </span>
      
    When x = -2 or 2, the statement 21x<sup>2</sup> + 4x - 32 evaluates to 44 and 60 respecitively, and both are > 0. <br>
    but when x = 0, the expression evaluates to -32, which is not > 0. <br>
    Hence, the answer is x <sup>-4</sup>/<sub>3</sub> and x > <sup>8</sup>/<sub>7</sub>. <br>

    <!-- Question 2: Complex Number Argand Diagram-->
  <div id = "Question_2">
    <img src = "" alt = "">

    <p class = "explanation centre"> For the next question, you'll have to draw an Argand diagram. <br>
      An Argand diagram is just a fancy name for a graph with a real x axis and an imaginary y axis. <br>
      The first of the equation <span class="equation">|z| ≥ 2</span> means the modulus of the complex number z is 2. The modulus is like the magnitude of the line drawn from the 
      origin to the complex number z. <br>
      
      This can be represented with a dashed line circle with radius 2 from the origin. Because it evaluates to ≥ 2, 
    we shade everything outside the circle since they all have ≥2 in terms of magnitude. <br> 
    Remember that dashed line means that 2 is within the boundary, whilst a solid line circle would mean that 2 would be outside of the boundary. <br>
     The second component is the <span class="equation">|z - 1 + 1| ≤ 1.</span> <br>
     First we invert everything after the z to get the complex number 1 - i. Draw a dot at this point in the Argand diagram, 1 along the real axis and -1 along the 
     imaginary axis. <br>  
     Then, draw a dashed line circle with radius 1 and shade everything within the circle. <br>
     The overlapping shaded regions of the first and second
     equation are the values of z that satisfy both |z| ≥ 2 and |z - 1 + i| ≤ 1.

    <p class = "explanation centre"> We are given a definition for x and y and are asked to find <sup>dy</sup>/<sub>dx</sub>. <br>
       Notice how both x and y share a common variable θ. We can use this to link x and y. <br>
      If we find <sup>dx</sup>/<sub>dθ</sub> and <sup>dy</sup>/<sub>dθ</sub>, we can then rearrange them and multiply
      to find <sup>dy</sup>/<sub>dx</sub>. <br>

      Notice how both x and y have a double angle within their trig function. <br> 
      We can replace these with their non-double equivalent to differentiate them more easily. <br>

      <span class = "equation">
      x = 3 - cos(2θ) <br>

      <sup>dx</sup>/<sub>dθ</sub> = 4sin(θ)cos(θ) <br>

      now we'll find <sup>dy</sup>/<sub>dθ</sub> <br>

      <span class = "equation">

      y = 2θ + 2sin(θ)cos(θ) <br>

      <sup>dy</sup>/<sub>dθ</sub> = 2 + 2(cos<sup>2</sup>>(θ) - sin<sup>2</sup>>(θ)) <br>
      <sup>dy</sup>/<sub>dθ</sub> = 2(1 + cos<sup>2</sup>>(θ) - sin<sup>2</sup>>(θ)) <br>

      <sup>dy</sup>/<sub>dθ</sub> = 4cos<sup>2</sup>>(θ) <br>

  <!--Question 4: Logs-->

  <div id = "Question_4">

  <img src = "Q4.png" alt = "Solve the equation log(2x + 1) = 2 log(x + 1) − 1.">
    <p class = "explanation centre"> The first thing you should notice is that all of the terms escept for one are in logs. <br>
    To simplify problems like these, we can attempt to convert every term into log-based terms. <br>
    This is not always possible but 1 is a very convenient number because it is simply log 10. <br>
       
    <span class = "equation">
    log(2x + 1) = 2log(x + 1) - 1 <br>
    log(2x + 1) = 2log(x + 1) - log(10) <br>
    </span>

    now we can apply some log laws. We'll use the following:
    <span class = "equation">
    
    Alog(B) = log(B<sup>A</sup>) <br>
    log(A) + log(B) = log(AB) <br>

    log(2x + 1) + log(10) = log((x + 1)<sup>2</sup>>) <br>
    log(20x + 10) = log((x + 1)<sup>2</sup>>) <br>
    </span>

    because both sides now have only a singular log, we can completely remove it them. <br>
    Then it's a simple matter or rearranging and finding x with the quadratic formula. <br>

    <span class = "equation">
    20x + 10 = (x + 1)<sup>2</sup> <br>
    20x + 10 = x<sup>2</sup>> + 2x + 1 <br>

    <!-- Question 5: Placeholder-->


    <!-- Question 6a: Double Angles -->
<div id = "Question_6">
    <img src="" alt = "√6cos(θ) + 3sin(θ)">


    <p class = "explanation">
      The value of √6cos(θ) + 3sin(θ) will fluctuate from a minimum to a maximum, depending on the angle θ. <br>
      For every form of Acos(θ) + Bsin(θ), the value of θ which will yield the maximum value will differ. <br>
      For example, in 10cos(θ) - 10sin(θ), the max value will be 10 when θ is 0 degrees, but in -10cos(θ) + 10sin(θ), the max value will
      still be 10, but it will occur when θ is 180 degrees or π radians. <br>

      However, the one thing that will stay constant no matter the way to caclulate the max value. <br>
      It will always be √(A<sup>2</sup>> + B<sup>2</sup>>). This is known as the modulus, or the hypotenuse of 
      the triangle, or the length of the line. <br>
      It's interesting but should be expected that the concept of triangles would come up in a topic about angles. <br>

      Notice that the question asks for the form Rcos(θ - α). R is the maximum value, and this expression
      will fluctuate from -R to R depending on θ. <br>
       α is a constant. α is the angle at which the max value R will occur. <br>
       If you noticed, at angle θ = α, the expression will become Rcos(0) which is simply R. <br>

      Anyways on to the question; <br>

      <span class = "equation">
      R = √(A<sup>2</sup> + B<sup>2</sup>)
      R = √(6 + 9)
      R = √15
      </span>

      We can now use the double angle formula to expand Rcos(θ - α) <br>

      <span class="equation">
      Rcos(θ - α) = R(cos(θ)cos(α) + sin(θ)sin(α)) 
      </span>

      now we'll substitute in R and compare it to the provided expression: <br>
      
      <span class = "equation">
      √6cos(θ) + 3sin(θ) = √15(cos(θ)cos(α) + sin(θ)sin(α)) <br>
      </span>

      From here, we'll substitute θ with very convenient values to get rid of some terms so that we can find α. <br> 
      These values are 0 and 180 degrees (or 0 and π radians). <br>
      Because the question mentions that 0 < α < 90, we'll use degrees instead of radians. <br>

      <span class = "equation">
      let θ =  180 deg; <br>
      sin(180) = 0 <br>
      cos(180) = 1 <br>

      3 + 0 = √15(0 + 1*sin(α)) <br>
      3 = √15sin(α) <br>
      α = arcsin(3 / √15) <br>
      α = 0.886 rad or 50.77 degrees <br>
      </span>


    </p>
  
    <!--Question 6B: Using the Formula-->
    

    <p class = "explanation centre">

      we can use the formula we made from 6A to solve this problem. <br>
      However, we'll remove all the additional components attached to the angle θ to simplify the expression. <br>
      This includes the (+ 50.77) and <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> components. <br>
      We will deal with this later. Therefore the formula we'll use is: <br>

      <span class = "equation">
       √15cos(θ) = 2.5 <br>
      </span>

       then we just rearrange to find θ. <br>

      <span class = "equation">
       cos(θ) = 2.5 / √15 <br>
       θ = arccos(2.5 / √15) <br>
       θ = 49.797 degrees <br>
      </span>

       We know that √15cos(θ - 50.77) APPROXIMATES to √6cos(θ) + 3sin(θ), and that
       √15cos(49.797) = 2.5. <br>

      <span class = "equation">
       So this means that: <br>
        θ = 49.8 + 50.8 <br>
        θ = 100.6 <br>
      </span>

        Finally, we need to approximate for √6cos(⅓x) + 3sin(⅓x), not √6cos(θ) + 3sin(θ). <br>
        So ⅓x = θ. So the first value of x is 3*100.6 = 301.8 <br>

        We now need to find the other values of x. The first value of θ is 49.797, so the 
        other nearest values we can try are -49.797 and 310.203. <br>
        We'll repeat the process to convert θ into x just like before, 
        by adding 50.77 and then multiplying by 3. <br>

      <span class = "equation">
        3(-49.797 + 50.77) = 2.92 <br>
        3(310.203 + 50.77) = 1082.92 <br>
      </span>

        It seems that 2.92 is another value of x that will yield an angle θ (-49.797) which satisfies
        √6cos(θ) + 3sin(θ) = 2.5 <br>


    </p>

    <!--Question 7A: Complex Numbers Factorisation-->

    <p class = "explanation"> If you have a good calculator, you can actually find the squared and cubed
      functions of the complex number -1 + √5i, but you'll still have to show your working. <br>

      <span class = "equation">
        x = -1 + √5i <br>

        x<sup>2</sup> = (-1 + √5i)(-1 + √5i) <br>
        x<sup>2</sup> = 1 - √5i - √5i + 5i<sup>2</sup> <br>
        x<sup>2</sup> = 1 - 5 - 2√5i <br>
        x<sup>2</sup> = -4 - 2√5i <br>

        x<sup>3</sup> = x<sup>2</sup> * x <br>
        x<sup>3</sup> = (-4 - 2√5i)(-1 + √5i)
        x<sup>3</sup> = 4 - 4√5i + 2√5i - 2(5)i<sup>2</sup>
        x<sup>3</sup> = 4 + 1- - 2√5i
        x<sup>3</sup> = 14 - 2√5i

      </span>

      Now that we have evaluated x, x<sup>2</sup> and x<sup>3</sup>, we can simply just substitute them in 
      and check if 2x<sup>3</sup> + x<sup>2</sup> + 6x - 18 = 0.

      <span class = "equation">
        2x<sup>3</sup> + x<sup>2</sup> + 6x - 18 = 0 <br>
        2(14 - 2√5i) + (-4 - 2√5i) + 6(-1 + √5i) - 18 = 0 <br>
        28 - 4√5i - 4 - 2√5i - 6 + 6√5i - 18 = 0

        </span>

        we'll separate the real and imaginary components and see if they will evaluate to 0. <br>

        <span class = "equation">
          (28 - 4 - 6 - 18) + (-4√5i - 2√5i + 6√5i) = 0 <br>
          0 + 0i = 0 <br>
        </span>

  </div>

    <!--Question 7B: Complex Numbers Factorisation part 2-->
    <div id = "Question_7"> 

    <p class = "explanation">
      From the previous question, we know that one of the roots of the polynomial 2x<sup>3</sup> + x<sup>2</sup> + 6x - 18 = 0 is -1 + 5i. <br>
      In bracket form this is (x + 1 - 5i). Notice how A*B*(x + 1 - 5i) = 0, if we put x = -1 + 5i, the expression is true no matter what A or B is. <br>
      The polynomial does not equal to a so we can immediately tell that one of the other roots is the complement which is -1 - 5i, or (x + 1 + 5i) in brackets. <br>
      This is because this is the only other factor that when multiplied, gives a real number. And 0 does not have any imaginary component. <br>

      <span class = "equation">

       (x + 1 - √5i)(x - 1 - √5i)(A) = 2x<sup>3</sup> + x<sup>2</sup> + 6x - 18 <br>
       (x + 1 - √5i)(x - 1 - √5i)(A) = 2x<sup>3</sup> + x<sup>2</sup> + 6x - 18 <br>

      </span>

      We'll now expand and organize the terms according to their x powers and i.

      <span class = "equation"></span>

       A(x<sup>2</sup> - x -√5ix + x - 1 - √5i - √5ix + √5i + 5i<sup>2</sup>) = 2x<sup>3</sup> + x<sup>2</sup> + 6x - 18 <br>
       x<sup>2</sup> + (x + x) + 1 + (√5 - √5)ix + (√5 - √5)i = 2x<sup>3</sup> + x<sup>2</sup> + 6x - 18 <br>
       x<sup>2</sup> + 2x + 6 + 0ix + 0i = 2x<sup>3</sup> + x<sup>2</sup> + 6x - 18 <br>

     <!--Question 8: Implicit Differentiation-->
     <div id = "Question_8"></div>

     <p class = "explanation centre"> If you look at the expression x <sup>dy</sup>/<sub>dx</sub> = (1 - 2x<sup>2</sup>)y, you'll
      notice that there is both a dy and a dx. This is a sign that this is an ODE (Ordinary Differential Equation). <br>
      The very first thing we should do to intergrate this expression is to rearrange it so that all the x and y are separated. <br>
      If we do this, we'll get: <br>

      <span class = "equation">
        ∫<sup>1</sup>/<sub>y</sub>.dy = ∫<sup>(1-2x<sup>2</sup>)</sup>/<sub>x</sub> <br>
        ∫<sup>1</sup>/<sub>y</sub>.dy = ∫<sup>1</sup>/<sub>x</sub>.dx - ∫2x.dx <br>
      </span>

      In this form, we can easily just integrate the three terms separately. <br>
      Remember that ∫<sup>A</sup>/<sub>∫A.dA</sub> evaluates to lnA. eg ∫<sup>1</sup>/<sub>A</sub>.dA will always
      be lnA since any constant A will differentiate into 1.

      <span class = "equation">

      ln(y) = ln(x) - x<sup>2</sup> <br> + c
      </span>

      Technically, there are two constants on both sides of the equal sign, but we can just merge them together
      into a single constant c. We can keep use log laws to rearrange this expression into:

      <span class = "equation">
        e<sup>(-x<sup>2</sup> + c)</sup> = <sup>y</sup>/<sub>x</sub> <br>
        xe<sup>(-x<sup>2</sup> + c)</sup> = y <br>


      </span>

      However I recommend NOT doing this until you find the constant c because it's a lot more difficult to work with 
      exponentials than log or ln. <br>
      We are provided that y = 1 when x = 1, so we'll substitute in to find c. <br>

      <span class = "equation">
        ln(1) = ln(1) - 1 + c <br>
        ln(1) - ln(1) + 1 = c <br>
        c = 1 <br>
      </span>

      so the final expression for y is:

      <span class="equation">
        xe<sup>(1 - x<sup>2</sup>)</sup> = y <br>
      </span>

    <!--Question 9A: Partial Fractions-->
    <div class = "Question 9">
      <p class = "explanation centre">
        This is a simple partial fractions question. As you can see from the numerator, there are a total
       of three factors; (1 - x), (2 + 3x) and (2 + 3x)<sup>2</sup>. <br>
       If you are wondering why (2 + 3x) and (2 + 3x)<sup>2</sup> are separate factors, think of the number
       18. 18's PRIME factors are 2, 3 and 3. However, 6 and 9 are also factors of 18. <br>
       Remember that 1 is not usually considered to be a factor, so we can ignore 1 and 18 as factors of 18. <br>
       
       So we'll setup our answer: <br>

       <span class = "equation">

        <sup>(8 + 5x + 12x<sup>2</sup>)</sup>/<sub>(1 - x)(2 + 3x)<sup>2</sup></sub> =

       </span>

       Remember that we only put Ax + B as the numerator when the form of the denominator is (x<sup>2</sup> + K) where K is a constant. <br>
       Now, we can eliminate all denominators by multiplying everything by: <br>

       <span class = "equation">

        (8 + 5x + 12x<sup>2</sup>) = A(2 + 3x)<sup>2</sup> + B(2 + 3x)(1 - x) + C(1 - x) <br>

       We can substitute x = <sup>-2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> and x = 1 to remove the first and second, then the second
       and third terms respectively to find A and C. Then we can use x = 0 to find B. <br>
       You can actually use any value of x to find B, but 0 is the most convenient number to use because it 
       replaces all x-terms with 0. <br>

       <span class = "equation">
        x = <sup>-2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> <br>
        (8 + 5(<sup>-2</sup>/<sub>3</sub>) + 12(<sup>-2</sup>/<sub>3</sub><sup>2</sup>) = C(1 - <sup>-2</sup>/<sub>3</sub>)
        10 = <sup>5</sup>/<sub>3</sub>C
        C = 6 <br>

        x = 1 <br>
        (8 + 5(1) + 12(1)<sup>2</sup>) = A(2(1) + 3)<sup>2</sup> <br>
        25 = 25A <br>
        A = 1 <br>

        x = 0 <br>
        8 = 4A + 2B + C <br>
        8 = 4 + 2B + 6 <br>
        -2 = 2B <br>
        B = -1 <br>

       </span>

       Now the question is as easy as ABC. <br>

       <span class="equation">
        <sup>(8 + 5x + 12x<sup>2</sup>)</sup>/<sub>(1 - x)(2 + 3x)<sup>2</sup></sub> = 
        <sup>1</sup>/<sub>(1 - x)</sub> + <sup>-1</sup>/<sub>(2 + 3x)</sub> + <sup>6</sup>/<sub>(2 + 3x<sup>2</sup>)</sub>
       </span>

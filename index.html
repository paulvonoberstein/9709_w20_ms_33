    <!-- Question 1: Modulus -->
    
    <img src = "Q1.png" alt = " Q1: Solve the inequality 2 - 5x > 2|x-3|">
    
    
    <p class = "explanation centre"> The safest way to do this question is to square both sides and use a number line to check your answer. <br>
       Note that the modulus function and the square function are similar in that they both invert negative values but leaves positive values alone.<br>

    <span class = "equation">
    (2 - 5x)<sup>2</sup> > (2|x - 3|)<sup>2</sup> <br>
    25x<sup>2</sup> - 20x + 4 > 4(x<sup>2</sup> - 6x + 9) <br>
    25x<sup>2</sup> - 20x + 4 > 4x<sup>2</sup> - 24x + 36 <br>
    21x<sup>2</sup> + 4x - 32 > 0 <br>
    </span>
     
    This is not a simple quadratic to solve, but we can use the quadratic formula to get: <br>
    
    <span class="equation">
    x = <sup>-4</sup>/<sub>3</sub> or <sup>8</sup>/<sub>7</sub> <br>
    </span>
      
    note that you should use an = instead of a > or < at this stage. We have to use a number line to check the region(s) of the answer. <br> 
    We'll check using -2, 0 and 2. As for the reason; 0 is a very convenient number to try because any term which contains x will turn into 0.  
    Always try 0 when your number line contains a positive and a negative number. <br> 
    -2 and 2 are the smallest whole numbers above and below <sup>-4</sup>/<sub>3</sub> and <sup>8</sup>/<sub>7</sub>, but you can try any number within the regions x < <sup>-4</sup>/<sub>3</sub> 
    and the other region x > <sup>8</sup>/<sub>7</sub>. <br>
      
    <span class="equation">
    21(-2)<sup>2</sup> + 4(-2) - 32 = 44 <br>
    21(0) + 4(0) - 32 = -32 <br>
    21(2)<sup>2</sup> + 4(2) - 32 = 60 <br>
    </span>
      
    When x = -2 or 2, the statement 21x<sup>2</sup> + 4x - 32 evaluates to 44 and 60 respecitively, and both are > 0. <br>
    but when x = 0, the expression evaluates to -32, which is not > 0. <br>
    Hence, the answer is x < <sup>-4</sup>/<sub>3</sub> and x > <sup>8</sup>/<sub>7</sub>. <br>

    <!-- Question 2: Complex Number-->

    <img src = "" alt = "">

    <p class = "explanation centre"> For the next question, you'll have to draw an Argand diagram. <br>
      An Argand diagram is just a fancy name for a graph with a real x axis and an imaginary y axis. <br>
      The first of the equation <span class="equation">|z| ≥ 2</span> means the modulus of the complex number z is 2. The modulus is like the magnitude of the line drawn from the 
      origin to the complex number z. <br>
      
      This can be represented with a dashed line circle with radius 2 from the origin. Because it evaluates to ≥ 2, 
    we shade everything outside the circle since they all have ≥2 in terms of magnitude. <br> 
    Remember that dashed line means that 2 is within the boundary, whilst a solid line circle would mean that 2 would be outside of the boundary. <br>
     The second component is the <span class="equation">|z - 1 + 1| ≤ 1.</span> <br>
     First we invert everything after the z to get the complex number 1 - i. Draw a dot at this point in the Argand diagram, 1 along the real axis and -1 along the 
     imaginary axis. <br>  
     Then, draw a dashed line circle with radius 1 and shade everything within the circle. <br>
     The overlapping shaded regions of the first and second
     equation are the values of z that satisfy both |z| ≥ 2 and |z - 1 + i| ≤ 1.

    <!--Question 3: Differentitation-->
    <img src = "" alt = "">
    <p class = "equation"> We are given a definition for x and y and are asked to find <sup>dy</sup>/<sub>dx</sub>. <br>
       Notice how both x and y share a common variable θ. We can use this to link x and y. <br>
      If we find <sup>dx</sup>/<sub>dθ</sub> and <sup>dy</sup>/<sub>dθ</sub>, we can then rearrange them and multiply
      to find <sup>dy</sup>/<sub>dx</sub>. <br>

      Notice how both x and y have a double angle within their trig function. <br> 
      We can replace these with their non-double equivalent to differentiate them more easily. <br>

      <span class = "equation">
      x = 3 - cos(2θ) <br>
      x = 3 - (1 - 2sin<sup>2</sup>(θ)) <br>

      x = 2 + 2sin<sup>2</sup>>(θ) <br>
      <sup>dx</sup>> = 0 + 2 * 2sin(θ) * cos(θ) <br>
      <sup>dx</sup>/<sub>dθ</sub> = 4sin(θ)cos(θ) <br>
      </span>

      now we'll find <sup>dy</sup>/<sub>dθ</sub>

      <span class = "equation">
      y = 2θ + sin(2θ) <br>
      y = 2θ + 2sin(θ)cos(θ) <br>
      <sup>dy</sup> = 2 + 2(sin(θ) * -sin(θ) + cosθ * cos(θ)) <br>
      <sup>dy</sup>/<sub>dθ</sub> = 2 + 2(cos<sup>2</sup>>(θ) - sin<sup>2</sup>>(θ)) <br>
      <sup>dy</sup>/<sub>dθ</sub> = 2(1 + cos<sup>2</sup>>(θ) - sin<sup>2</sup>>(θ)) <br>
      </span>

      here we'll replace 1 with cos<sup>2</sup>>(θ) + sin<sup>2</sup>>(θ) <br>

      <span class = "equation">
      <sup>dy</sup>/<sub>dθ</sub> = 2(cos<sup>2</sup>>(θ) + sin<sup>2</sup>>(θ) + cos<sup>2</sup>>(θ) - sin<sup>2</sup>>(θ)) <br>
      <sup>dy</sup>/<sub>dθ</sub> = 2(2cos<sup>2</sup>>(θ)) <br>
      <sup>dy</sup>/<sub>dθ</sub> = 4cos<sup>2</sup>>(θ) <br>
      
      <sup>dy</sup>/<sub>dx</sub> = <sup>dy</sup>/<sub>dθ</sub> * dθ/dx <br>
      <sup>dy</sup>/<sub>dx</sub> = 4cos<sup>2</sup>>(θ) / 4sin(θ)cos(θ) <br>
      <sup>dy</sup>/<sub>dx</sub> = cot(θ) <br>

  <!--Question 4: Logs-->

  <img src = "Q4.png" alt = "Solve the equation log(2x + 1) = 2 log(x + 1) − 1.">
    <p class = "explanation centre"> The first thing you should notice is that all of the terms escept for one are in logs. <br>
    To simplify problems like these, we can attempt to convert every term into log-based terms. <br>
    This is not always possible but 1 is a very convenient number because it is simply log 10. <br>
       
    <span class = "equation">
    log(2x + 1) = 2log(x + 1) - 1 <br>
    log(2x + 1) = 2log(x + 1) - log(10) <br>
    </span>

    now we can apply some log laws. We'll use the following:
    <span class = "equation">
    
    Alog(B) = log(B<sup>A</sup>) <br>
    log(A) + log(B) = log(AB) <br>

    log(2x + 1) + log(10) = log((x + 1)<sup>2</sup>>) <br>
    log(20x + 10) = log((x + 1)<sup>2</sup>>) <br>
    </span>

    because both sides now have only a singular log, we can completely remove it them. <br>
    Then it's a simple matter or rearranging and finding x with the quadratic formula. <br>

    <span class = "equation">
    20x + 10 = (x + 1)<sup>2</sup> <br>
    20x + 10 = x<sup>2</sup>> + 2x + 1 <br>
    x<sup>2</sup>> - 18x - 9 = 0 <br>
    x = 9 ± 3√10 <br>

    <!-- Question 5: Placeholder-->


    <!-- Question 6a: Double Angles -->

    <img src="" alt = "√6*cos(θ) + 3sin(θ)">


    <p class = "explanation">
      The value of √6cos(θ) + 3sin(θ) will fluctuate from a minimum to a maximum, depending on the angle θ. <br>
      For every form of Acos(θ) + Bsin(θ), the value of θ which will yield the maximum value will differ. <br>
      For example, in 10cos(θ) - 10sin(θ), the max value will be 10 when θ is 0 degrees, but in -10cos(θ) + 10sin(θ), the max value will
      still be 10, but it will occur when θ is 180 degrees or π radians. <br>

      However, the one thing that will stay constant no matter the way to caclulate the max value. <br>
      It will always be √(A<sup>2</sup>> + B<sup>2</sup>>). This is known as the modulus, or the hypotenuse of 
      the triangle, or the length of the line. <br>
      It's interesting but expected that the concept of triangles would come up in a topic about angles. <br>

      Notice that the question asks for the form Rcos(θ - α). R is the maximum value, and this expression
      will fluctuate from -R to R depending on θ. <br>
       α is a constant. α is the angle at which the max value R will occur. <br>
       If you noticed, at angle θ = α, the expression will become Rcos(0) which is simply R. <br>

      Anyways on to the question; <br>

      <span class = "equation">
      R = √(A<sup>2</sup> + B<sup>2</sup>)
      R = √(6 + 9)
      R = √15
      </span>

      We can now use the double angle formula to expand Rcos(θ - α) <br>

      <span = class="equation">
      Rcos(θ - α) = R * (cos(θ)cos(α) + sin(θ)sin(α)) 
      </span>

      now we'll substitute in R and compare it to the provided expression: <br>
      
      √6cos(θ) + 3sin(θ) = √15 * (cos(θ)cos(α) + sin(θ)sin(α)) <br>

      From here, we'll substitute θ with very convenient values to get rid of some terms so that we can find α. <br> 
      These values are 0 and 180 degrees (or 0 and π radians). <br>
      Because the question mentions that 0 < α < 90, we'll use degrees instead of radians. <br>

      <span class = "equation">
      let θ =  180 deg; <br>
      sin(180) = 0 <br>
      cos(180) = 1 <br>

      3 + 0 = √15(0 + 1*sin(α)) <br>
      3 = √15sin(α) <br>
      α = arcsin(3 / √15) <br>
      α = 0.886 rad or 50.77 degrees <br>
      </span>

    <!--Question 6B: Using the Formula-->

    <p>

      we can use the formula we made from 6A to solve this problem. However, we'll remove all 
      the additional components attached to the angle θ. We will deal with this later. Therefore
      the formula we'll use is:

       √15*cos(θ) = 2.5

       then we just rearrange to find θ. 

       cos(θ) = 2.5 / √15
       θ = arccos(2.5 / √15)
       θ = 49.797 degrees

       We know that √15cos(θ - 50.77) APPROXIMATES to √6cos(θ) + 3sin(θ), and that
       √15cos(49.797) = 2.5. 

       So this means that:
        θ = 49.8 + 50.8 
        θ = 100.6

        Finally, we need to approximate for √6cos(⅓x) + 3sin(⅓x), not √6cos(θ) + 3sin(θ).
        So ⅓x = θ. So the first value of x is 3*100.6 = 301.8

        We now need to find the other values of x. The first value of θ is 49.797, so the 
        other nearest values we can try are -49.797 and 310.203. We'll repeat the process to 
        convert θ into x just like before, by adding 50.77 and then multiplying by 3.

        3*(-49.797 + 50.77) = 2.92
        3*(310.203 + 50.77) = 1082.92

        It seems that 2.92 is another value of x that will yield an angle θ (-49.797) which satisfies
        √6cos(θ) + 3sin(θ) = 2.5

    <h1> Q1: Solve the inequality 2 - 5x > 2|x-3|</h1>

    <p> The safest way to do this is to square both sides and use a number line to check your answer. Note that the modulus function
    and the square function are similar in that they both invert negative values but leaves positive values alone.
    
    (2 - 5x)^2 > (2*|x-3|)^2
    25x^2 - 20x + 4 > 4*(x^2 - 6x + 9)
    25x^2 - 20x + 4 > 4x^2 - 24x + 36
    21x^2 + 4x - 32 > 0
     
    This is not a simple quadratic, but we can use the quadratic formula to get:
    
    x = -4/3 or 8/7
      
    note that you should use an = instead of a > or < at this stage. We have to use a number line to check the region(s) of the answer. 
    We'll check using -2, 0 and 2. 0 is a very convenient number to try and you should definitely use it if your number line contains 
    a positive and a negative number. -2 and 2 are the smallest whole numbers above and below -4/3 and 8/7. 
      
    21(-2)^2 + 4(-2) - 32 = 44
    21(0) + 4(0) - 32 = -32
    21(2)^2 + 4(2) - 32 = 60
      
    When x = 2 or -2, the statement 21x^2 + 4x - 32 > 0 is true, but when x = 0, the condition is not true. Hence, the answer is x < -4/3 and x > 8/7.

    <p> For the next question, you'll have to draw an Argand diagram. An Argand diagram is just a fancy way of
      describing a graph with a real x axis and an imaginary y axis.
